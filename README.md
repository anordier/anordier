Hi! Iâ€™m Alexis Nordier, a student in TÃ©lÃ©com SudParis, a computer science engineering school based in Ã‰vry-Courcouronnes, south of Paris (hence the name ðŸ˜Š)
You may not find a lot of interesting stuff in here, as I don't code enough on my free time to have much more on here than class-related projects.
(And even then, they're most likely going to remain private)
But hey, maybe some of this will be of use to *someone*

If you're feeling like telling me something, I happen to have an email address (like most people do in these trying times): nordier.alexis@gmail.com
